## What is Arbitrum Orbit?

Arbitrum Orbit is a suite of technologies designed to enhance the scalability and performance of Ethereum through Layer 2 & Layer 3 solutions. Developed by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum Orbit leverages rollup technology to provide faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.

### Key Features of Arbitrum Orbit

- **Scalability:** Arbitrum Orbit significantly increases the throughput of Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain and only posting summaries on-chain. This reduces congestion and lowers transaction costs.

- **Security:** Despite operating off-chain, Arbitrum Orbit inherits the security of Ethereum by utilizing fraud proofs and other mechanisms to ensure that the off-chain computations are correct.

- **EVM Compatibility:** Arbitrum Orbit is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts without modifications.

### Integration with Molten

Molten utilizes the Arbitrum Orbit codebase to power its Layer 3 rollup, providing a highly scalable and efficient platform tailored for trading activities. By building on Arbitrum Orbit, Molten benefits from:

- **Enhanced Performance:** Leveraging Arbitrum Orbitâ€™s scalability features ensures that Molten can handle a high volume of transactions with minimal latency.
  
- **Battle Tested:** The resilience of the Arbitrum codebase breathes confidence for when Molten onboards millions of traders and transactions onto the network.

- **Robust Security:** Molten inherits the robust security model of Arbitrum Orbit, ensuring that all transactions and smart contracts are secure and reliable.

### Why Choose Arbitrum Orbit?

Arbitrum Orbit offers a unique combination of scalability, security, and compatibility that makes it an ideal foundation for Layer 2 and Layer 3 solutions. By integrating Arbitrum Orbit, Molten is positioned to provide a superior trading platform that meets the needs of modern traders and protocols.

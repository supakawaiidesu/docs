## Stylus EVM+

Molten Network leverages the Arbitrum Stylus EVM+ to enhance its smart contract capabilities, allowing developers to build with a wide range of popular programming languages. This integration provides numerous benefits and expands the possibilities for dApp development on Molten.

### Key Features of Stylus EVM+

- **Multi-Language Support:** Stylus enables developers to write smart contracts in languages that compile down to WASM (WebAssembly), such as Rust, C, and C++. This opens up blockchain development to a much larger pool of developers who are proficient in these languages.
  
- **EVM and WASM Interoperability:** Stylus introduces a second virtual machine that executes WASM, running alongside the EVM. This allows for seamless interaction between Solidity contracts and those written in WASM-compatible languages.

- **Enhanced Performance:** WASM programs are significantly faster and more efficient than EVM bytecode, offering over a 10x improvement in execution speed and significantly lower gas fees. This efficiency is due to decades of compiler development for languages like Rust and C.

- **Cost Savings:** Memory usage can be up to 100-500x cheaper when using Stylus, making it viable to develop new use cases that require extensive RAM consumption.

- **Secure and Reliable:** Stylus benefits from Arbitrum Nitro's fraud-proofing technology, which ensures that any disputes can be resolved on-chain using deterministic proofs. This enhances the security and reliability of smart contracts deployed on Molten.

### Benefits for Molten Network

By integrating Stylus EVM+, Molten Network can provide its users with a range of advanced features and benefits:

- **Developer Flexibility:** Developers can choose their preferred programming language, making it easier to onboard new talent and utilize existing codebases. This flexibility encourages innovation and rapid development of new applications.
  
- **Cheaper and Faster Transactions:** The efficiency of WASM execution leads to lower transaction costs and faster processing times, making Molten an attractive platform for developers and users alike.

- **Advanced Use Cases:** The reduced costs and increased efficiency enable new, previously impractical use cases such as compute-heavy AI models, generative art, and complex simulations to be built on Molten.

- **Opt-In Reentrancy Protection:** Stylus provides built-in mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks, a common vulnerability in smart contracts. This ensures a higher level of security for applications built on Molten.

### Getting Started with Stylus on Molten

To start building with Stylus on Molten, developers can use the Stylus SDK and CLI tools to write and deploy smart contracts in supported languages like Rust, C, and C++. The Stylus testnet is open to all, providing an opportunity to explore the capabilities of this powerful upgrade.

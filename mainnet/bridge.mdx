## Molten Bridge

The Molten Bridge is the standard optimistic bridge used on Arbitrum, allowing users to deposit and withdraw assets to and from the Molten Network. Hereâ€™s how to use the bridge effectively.

### Bridge Overview

- **Deposits:** Bridging assets into the Molten Network takes between 15-30 minutes.
- **Withdrawals:** Bridging assets out of the Molten Network takes 7-8 days.
- **Security:** The bridge only supports the native bridge, which has the highest security assumptions for users. There is no fast bridge available.

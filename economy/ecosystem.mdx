## Protocol Use Cases

The MOLTEN token is integral to the operations and incentive structures of protocols deployed on the Molten Network. Currently, UniDex is the primary protocol utilizing MOLTEN to power its operations.

### UniDex

UniDex is a decentralized exchange protocol that leverages the unique features of the Molten Network to provide an efficient and secure trading experience. Here’s how UniDex is using MOLTEN to enhance its protocol:

#### Buyback and Burn Mechanism

- **Protocol Fees:** UniDex uses 50% of its protocol fees to buy back and burn MOLTEN tokens. This mechanism helps control inflation and supports the token’s value by reducing the circulating supply.
- **Deflationary Impact:** The buyback and burn process creates a deflationary pressure on the MOLTEN token, contributing to its long-term value proposition and stability.

#### Incentives from the Molten Community

- **Trading Rewards:** UniDex receives incentives from the bimonthly budget set by the Molten community to reward active traders. These incentives help attract and retain traders on the platform, driving liquidity and trading volume.
- **LP Rewards:** Liquidity providers on UniDex are also incentivized through the community-allocated budget. These rewards ensure that there is sufficient liquidity for various trading pairs, enhancing the trading experience for all users.

### Benefits for UniDex and the Molten Network

- **Enhanced Liquidity:** The LP rewards program helps maintain high liquidity levels, making it easier for traders to execute large orders without significant slippage.
- **Increased Trading Activity:** Trading incentives attract more users to the platform, boosting trading volumes and generating more protocol fees, which in turn supports the buyback and burn mechanism.
- **Sustainable Ecosystem:** By balancing incentives with a deflationary token model, UniDex and the Molten Network create a sustainable and thriving ecosystem for all participants.

### Future Expansion

As more protocols are deployed on the Molten Network, the use cases for MOLTEN will continue to grow. Each new protocol will contribute to the ecosystem’s diversity and strength, further enhancing the value and utility of the MOLTEN token.

Stay tuned for updates on new protocol deployments and their innovative use of MOLTEN to power their operations.

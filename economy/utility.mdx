## Utility

The MOLTEN token plays a central role in the Molten Network, providing essential utility for transactions, governance, and community incentives.

### Native Gas Token

The MOLTEN token is the native gas token for the Molten Network. This means that all transactions on the network require MOLTEN to pay for gas fees. By using MOLTEN, users can ensure fast and efficient transaction processing on the network.

### Governance

MOLTEN is also used for governing both the UniDex protocol and the Molten protocol. Token holders have the power to participate in governance decisions, including protocol upgrades, parameter changes, and other key aspects of the ecosystem's development.

### Community and Ecosystem Incentives

The MOLTEN token serves as a tool to stimulate the ecosystem through various incentives:

- **Incentives for Ecosystem Apps:** MOLTEN can be used to incentivize developers and users to engage with and contribute to ecosystem applications. This can include rewards for using specific dapps, participating in governance, or contributing to the development of new features and functionalities.
  
- **Grants:** The community can use MOLTEN to fund grants that support innovative projects and initiatives within the Molten Network. These grants can help accelerate the growth and adoption of the ecosystem.
  
- **Community Building:** By holding MOLTEN, community members can band together to work towards common goals. This collective effort helps drive the adoption and success of the Molten Network.

### Migration from UNIDX

The founding team of UniDex migrated their original token, UNIDX, to the MOLTEN token. This migration ensures a unified token economy that powers both the UniDex protocol and the Molten Network.

The MOLTEN token's multifaceted utility as a gas token, governance token, and incentive mechanism makes it a vital component of the Molten Network, fostering growth, collaboration, and innovation within the ecosystem.

## esMOLTEN

The esMOLTEN mechanism is designed to incentivize ecosystem dapps by providing them with esMOLTEN tokens in the form of an NFT, which vests into MOLTEN over a period of one year. This innovative approach minimizes market impact and offers flexible incentives.

### How esMOLTEN Works

- **Incentives for Dapps:** Ecosystem dapps receive esMOLTEN tokens as an incentive to contribute to the growth and development of the Molten Network. These tokens are distributed in the form of an NFT.
  
- **Vesting Period:** The esMOLTEN tokens vest linearly into MOLTEN over one year. This gradual release minimizes the market impact by preventing large amounts of MOLTEN from being dumped into the market all at once.
  
- **Flexible Incentives:** The mechanism allows for flexible incentive sizes and terms, tailored to the specific needs and contributions of each dapp. This ensures that incentives are effectively aligned with the goals of the Molten Network.

- **Interoperability:** Vesting positions are interoperable, meaning that they can be transferred or utilized in various ways within the ecosystem.

- **Sustainability:** Vesting positions are claimable for 3 months. After this period, rewards cannot be claimed anymore. This is done to only reward active participants in the ecosystem and keep the total MOLTEN entering circulation low. We can draw a comparison to traditional pool2 farms where over 30% of farming rewards are never claimed. This mechanism prevents excess dormant circulation.

### Benefits of esMOLTEN

- **Market Stability:** By vesting MOLTEN linearly over a year, the esMOLTEN mechanism helps maintain market stability and reduces the risk of sudden price fluctuations.
  
- **Aligned Incentives:** Dapps are motivated to stay engaged with the Molten Network for the long term, as their incentives are tied to the network's growth and success over the vesting period.
  
- **Transparency and Accountability:** The use of NFTs and the management by Sabiler ensure that the vesting process is transparent and that all participants are held accountable.

The esMOLTEN mechanism is a crucial component of the Molten Network's strategy to foster a thriving ecosystem of dapps, ensuring sustainable growth and collaboration.

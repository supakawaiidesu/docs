## Ecosystem Partners: Ponder.sh

Molten Network is proud to recommend Ponder.sh, leveraging their cutting-edge blockchain indexing software to enhance our ecosystem.

### What is Ponder.sh?

Ponder.sh is an open-source backend framework designed to rapidly build APIs for any EVM smart contract. With Ponder, developers can create powerful GraphQL APIs based on smart contract events, making it easier to build and maintain crypto applications.


### Key Features of Ponder.sh

- **Powerful Local Dev Server:** Ponder provides a robust local development server with hot reloading, allowing developers to build and test their applications quickly and efficiently.
- **Fast & Lean Indexing:** Ponder indexes approximately 10x faster than traditional Graph Protocol subgraphs, ensuring rapid data synchronization and minimal resource usage.
- **Type Safety:** End-to-end type safety and autocomplete features eliminate the need for code generation, streamlining the development process.
- **One-Click Deploys:** Deploy your applications anywhere that runs Node.js with zero downtime and horizontal scaling capabilities.

### Benchmark Performance

Ponder.sh outperforms traditional indexing solutions, offering significant improvements in speed, efficiency, and resource utilization. Here are some benchmark results comparing Ponder to The Graph:

| Metric                | Ponder            | The Graph       |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Sync (Cold)           | 37s               | 5m 28s          |
| Sync (Cache)          | 5s                | 1m 15s          |
| Database Size         | 31 MB             | 1.1 GB          |
| RPC Credits           | 108k              | 167k            |

These results are based on indexing the Rocket Pool ERC20 token contract on mainnet from block 18,600,000 to 18,718,056 on an M1 MacBook Pro (8 core, 16GB RAM) against an Alchemy node on the Growth plan.

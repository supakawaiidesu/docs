## Molten Oracles

Molten Network provides a highly efficient and secure environment for oracles, enabling them to operate with near-zero gas fees and enhanced protection against MEV (Miner Extractable Value) attacks.

### Efficient and Cost-Effective Oracle Operations

Thanks to Molten's Layer 3 architecture and utilization of Anytrust DA (Data Availability), oracles can submit transactions every 0.25 seconds to update hundreds of price feeds at virtually no cost. This is a significant improvement over other chains where the cost of frequent updates can be prohibitive.

#### Key Advantages

- **Near-Zero Gas Fees:** Oracles benefit from extremely low transaction costs, allowing them to update price feeds frequently without incurring significant expenses. For example, submitting transactions every 0.25 seconds is feasible on Molten, whereas it would be cost-prohibitive on other networks.
  
- **High Update Frequency:** The ability to update price feeds every 0.25 seconds ensures that data remains current and accurate, reducing the risk of outdated information being used in transactions and smart contracts.

- **Oracle MEV Protection:** Molten's built-in protections against oracle MEV ensure that oracle updates are executed fairly and securely. This prevents malicious actors from exploiting time delays between oracle updates and transaction execution, providing a safer environment for all users.

### Benefits for Protocols

- **Reliability and Trust:** With frequent updates and MEV protection, protocols can rely on Molten's oracles for accurate and timely data. This reduces the need for protocols to maintain their own centralized oracle solutions.
  
- **Cost Savings:** By utilizing Molten's oracles, protocols can save on the costs associated with running and maintaining independent oracle systems, allowing them to allocate resources more efficiently.

- **Enhanced Security:** The combination of near-zero gas fees and oracle MEV protection makes Molten's oracles a secure and cost-effective choice for any protocol looking to ensure data integrity and fairness.

Molten Network's support for oracles creates a robust and economical solution for frequent, secure data updates, making it an attractive option for protocols across the ecosystem.

## Molten Overview

Molten is a secure, ultra-low-cost rollup with OEV protection, specifically designed for traders. By tailoring the rollup to suit tradersâ€™ needs, Molten becomes the optimal network for all types of trading activities.

Molten uses the Arbitrum Orbit stack to create a custom-built Layer 3 for traders. Anyone is allowed to build on the network and contribute to the expanding ecosystem of protocols and traders.

### Key Features

- **Layer 3:** Molten offers fast and cheap transactions while maintaining the security of Ethereum. It is also EVM compatible, meaning any existing smart contract can be deployed on Molten with no changes required.
  
- **OEV Protection:** Molten offers OEV protection to all protocols that are deployed on Molten. This means that any protocol deployed on Molten is protected from any oracle frontrunning and possible latency arbitrage. Protocols can stop running centralized AWS keepers and call oracles on chain directly, without having to worry about frontrunning. That means faster trades for users, less fees needed to be charged by protocols, and more profits for liquidity providers.
  
- **100x Lower Gas Fees:** Molten offers 100x lower gas fees than leading rollup solutions. This means that traders can do 100x more trades for the same price. While protocols can also update on-chain more often.
  
- **Native Account Abstraction:** Molten offers native account abstraction, meaning users can pay gas fees in any token they want. This means users can pay gas fees in the token they are trading, or even in stablecoins. This makes it easier for users to trade, and also makes it easier for protocols to onboard new users.
  
- **Arbitrum Orbit stack:** Molten is built on the Arbitrum Orbit stack utilizing the Arbitrum codebase for its rollup. This means Molten is built on the most decentralized rollup stack to date while also leveraging the most performant tech stack at the same time.

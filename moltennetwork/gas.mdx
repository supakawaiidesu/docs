## Near Zero Gas Fees

Molten is designed to offer significantly cheaper transaction costs by leveraging its Layer 3 architecture and utilizing Anytrust DA (Data Availability). This results in near zero gas fees for users, making Molten an extremely cost-effective solution for various blockchain activities.

### Cost Efficiency

Because Molten operates as a Layer 3, it benefits from the scalability and efficiency improvements over traditional Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions. The use of Anytrust DA further enhances this by optimizing data availability, which reduces the costs associated with storing and processing transaction data.

For example, a transaction on Molten that uses 50,000 gas units costs roughly 0.00005 USD. This cost will decrease even further as more users adopt and utilize the network.

### Example Transaction Costs

Here are some examples of transaction costs on Molten compared to other platforms:

| **Transaction Type**     | **Gas Cost (USD)** |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Uniswap Transaction      | 0.00012            |
| UniDex Trade Transaction | 0.00007            |
| NFT Mint Transaction     | 0.00009            |
| Transfer Transaction     | 0.000025           |

### Benefits of Low Gas Fees

- **Increased Accessibility:** Lower transaction costs make blockchain technology more accessible to a wider audience, enabling more users to participate in the ecosystem.
- **Higher Frequency Trading:** Traders can execute more trades without worrying about high fees, leading to a more dynamic and active market.
- **Cost Savings:** Both users and protocols save on transaction costs, allowing for more efficient use of resources and higher profitability.

Molten's approach to minimizing gas fees ensures that users and developers can enjoy a seamless, cost-effective experience while maintaining high levels of security and performance.
